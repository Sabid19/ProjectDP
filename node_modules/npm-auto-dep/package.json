  "readme": "npm-auto-dep\n============\n\nTool that searches your node.js module source code for all `require`s of external modules.\nInteractively adds dependencies to package.json based on their metadata.\n\n##Installation\n\n    npm install -g npm-auto-dep\n\n##Usage\nWorks only on linux/unix/(probably MacOS). Won't probably ever work on Windows out-of-the-box.[1]\n\nChange directory to main directory of your module sources. Run\n\n    npm-auto-dep\n\nOr you can just\n\n    npm-auto-dep /home/kitten_killer/dev/src/node/MAD_protocols\n\nWhich will (try to) find all it's dependencies and add them to it's package.json .\n\nModule must be initialized first. Best with `npm init`.\n\n`npm-auto-dep` will ask you what to do with every single module it found, like this:\n\n    Add package when [2.5.1] from git repo: https://github.com/cujojs/when\n    [N/y/v/=/>/~/r/c/h]:\n\nIf you enter `h` it will display a hint:\n\n    [No/yes/version/=version/>=version/~version/repository/custom/help]\n\nWhere:\n* No - (default behaviour) dependency will not be changed. If it already is in dependencies, it will stay the same way\n* yes - dependecy will be added, but without version information. That is any version will satisfy.\n* version - custom version specification. You will be asked to enter semver version range.[2]\n* =version - exactly the module version installed will be requested.\n* >=version - same or higher version then one installed will be requested\n* ~version - similar version will be requested. See also semver range spec.\n* repository - npm is told to clone this dependency from metadata specified repository. Currently only git is supported.\n* custom - enter whatever you like, as long as npm can understand it. (Currently `npm-auto-dep` does not validate that)\n* help - display hints and ask again what to do.\n\nAfter you are done you will have to confirm or reject changes, like that:\n\n    Old dependencies:\n    { when: '>=2.5.1',\n      semver: '>=2.2.1',\n      optimist: '>=0.6.0',\n      colors: '>=0.6.2' }\n    \n    New dependencies:\n    { when: '>=2.5.0 <3.0.0',\n      semver: '>=2.2.1',\n      optimist: '>=0.6.0',\n      colors: '>=0.6.2' }\n    Overwrite dependencies in file /home/kitten_killer/dev/src/npm-auto-dep/package.json ?\n    [y/n]: \n \n[1]: You can get grep and find from cygwin or something and add them to your PATH.\nIt could work, unless some strange CLI argument parsing ensues. Anyway, if you are\na developer able and wiling to do it, you should start using Linux by this point.\n\n[2]: Like that:\n\n    Add package when [2.5.1] from git repo: https://github.com/cujojs/when\n    Already in dependencies in version: >=2.5.1\n    [N/y/v/=/>/r/h]: v\n    Enter version specification (see man 7 semver)\n    > >=2.5.0 <3.0.0\n",
